# microct-cunerf

This is the repository for a modified implementation of the "CuNeRF" method applied on micro-CT data. The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16242). Moreover, the hash-based encoding from the "[Instant NGP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05989)" paper and the regularization method from the "[RHINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12642)" paper are implemented on top of the original CuNeRF method.

This was done as our team's project for the Project in Computer Systems course at Uppsala University in the winter semester 2023/2024.
